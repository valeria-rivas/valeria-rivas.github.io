    <h1> Inspirational trip: 2020 edition  </h1> 
    <h2> During quarantine of 2020, I realized a traveling list. It is my favorite thing to do and at this point that is safer than going to the movie theater </h2>
    <h3> I spend my quarantine in a tiny apartment, the only thing I wanted to do afterwards was to connect with nature, and work on my mental health. Therefore, my family and I decided to do different trips while taking all the measurements required to nature. The first trip I took was to Puerto Rico where I enjoyed the tropical beaches and the mountains. When I came back NYC was re-opening and cases were rising so there was a lot of people talking about closing again and that's when I said been in the middle of nowhere is better than being in a 4x4 room so I went to Arizona and California to literally be in the middle of nowhere. Enjoy the pictures and be sure to stay Six-feet apart!</h3>
    
    <h4> Covid-19 is a thing, as mental health is. Make sure to be informed about both!</h4>
